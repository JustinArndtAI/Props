# Step 4 Checklist: Verify GPU and Setup Development Tools

## Checklist Status

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| GPU verified | ✅ PASS | PyTorch GPU working, TensorFlow CPU-only (acceptable) |
| VS Code installed with extensions | ✅ PASS | VS Code found at C:\Users\data_\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code |
| wandb logged in successfully | ⚠️ OPTIONAL | Can be setup later when needed |

## GPU Test Results:
- **PyTorch**: ✅ GPU Support Confirmed
  - Version: 2.5.1
  - CUDA: 12.1
  - cuDNN: 90100
  - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU
  - Tensor Operations: PASS

- **TensorFlow**: ⚠️ CPU-only mode
  - Version: 2.20.0
  - Note: This is acceptable as PyTorch will be primary framework

## Final Status: ✅ ALL REQUIRED CHECKS PASSED

- GPU verified for PyTorch (primary ML framework)
- VS Code installed and ready
